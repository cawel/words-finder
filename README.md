# Words Finder

## Description

You can either scatter letters in a ramdom fashion on a 5x5 matrix or type in letters yourself. Then you click a button to find all the existing words on the matrix. 

If you hover on one of the words found, its letters will highlight in the matrix.

This app was an exercice to experiment with JavaScript.


## Thanks

The source for the English words list is the [12Dicts by Alan Beale](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/). Changes to the original words list include removing the duplicates and changing the format (so that I could have a file with 1 word per line). It now contains 80 863 words.

I asked a few people for a code review. Here are the people I want to thank:
