# Words Finder

## Description

You can either scatter letters in a ramdom fashion on a 5x5 matrix or type in letters yourself. Then you can click a button to find all the existing words on the matrix. 

If you hover on one of the words found, its letters will highlight in the matrix.

## Motivation

This app was an exercice to experiment with JavaScript.


## Thanks

The English words list used is the [12Dicts by Alan Beale](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/). Changes to the original words list includes removing the duplicates and changing the format (to 1 word per line). It now contains 80 863 words.

I asked a few people for a code review. Here are the people I want to thank:
