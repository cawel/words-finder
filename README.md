# Words Finder

## Description

You can either scatter letters in a ramdom fashion on the letters matrix or type in the letters yourself. Then you can click a button to find all the existing words in the letters matrix. 

If you hover on one of the words found, its letters will highlight in the matrix.

The app finds all words of 3 to 6 letters. I wish I could do up to 7 letters, but it's too slow. Could you do it? :)

## Motivation

This app was an exercice to experiment with JavaScript.


## Thanks

The source for the English words list is the [12Dicts by Alan Beale](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/). Changes to the original words list include removing the duplicates and changing the format (so that I could have a file with 1 word per line). It now contains 80 863 words.

I asked a few people for a code review. Here are the people I want to thank:
